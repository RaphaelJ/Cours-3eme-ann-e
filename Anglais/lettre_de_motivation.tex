\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

I'm a bachelor student who lives in Belgium and I'm looking for an unpaid
internship from February 13 to May 18 2012, for the end of my studies.

I'm allowed to achieve my internship in any European company, thanks to
ERASMUS.

I'm applying for your company because I've some skills with the Haskell
programming language. I'm not the most skilled Haskell programmer, but I'm able
to do some modestly complicated things with it.

I don't speak Dutch, but I can speak English enough to make myself understood,
and I will really enjoy learning some Dutch basics. I'm a French native speaker.

When a company accepts an internship from my school, one of your employees must
sponsor the student (answer questions, give some help for the team's integration
\dots) and write a (short) report for the professors after the internship.

I have attached my English resume with this message and the rules of the
internship from my school (in French, I'm looking for an English translation).

I would be very grateful if you would agree to give me a placement in your
company.

\closing{Yours Faithfully,}

\end{letter}
